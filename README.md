# 📄 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment-ready code.

---

## 🎯 Task Objectives

- Analyze credit card transaction data.
- Preprocess the data (handling imbalance, missing values, feature scaling).
- Train machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions.
- Evaluate model performance with precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Build a clean, well-commented, and structured codebase.

## 🚀 Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PayalBari1010/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.git
cd Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
```

2. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**

> ⚠️ Note: The dataset files (`fraudTrain.csv`, `fraudTest.csv`) are not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limits.

- Download the dataset from your data source (example: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
- Place the files inside the `data/` folder:
  - `data/fraudTrain.csv`
  - `data/fraudTest.csv`

4. **Run the Project**

```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```
